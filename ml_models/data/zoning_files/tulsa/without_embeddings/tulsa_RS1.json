A special exception granted for a community group home use will immediately become void upon final revocation of any required state license.\n C.To avoid over-concentration, community group homes in RE, RS or RD zoning districts may not be located within one thousand three hundred (1,300) feet of any other community group home. This separation requirement is established, not on the basis of any disability status, but on the basis of the non-family status of the groups. The required separation distance must be measured in a straight line from the nearest lot lines of the lots occupied by the community group home uses.\n D.In order to allow for special accommodations for inhabitants of community group homes, the board of adjustment is authorized, by special exception, to reduce or eliminate the separation distance requirement upon a finding that the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act, as amended, requires it, or that the grant of the special exception will not be injurious to the neighborhood or detrimental to the public welfare and will be in harmony with the spirit and intent of this zoning code. In consideration of granting this special exception, the board of adjustment must specifically consider the following factors:\n 1.Traffic and parking congestion given the capacity of nearby streets;\n 2.The likelihood that any other applicable group home use will impact traffic and parking congestion;\n 3.Traffic hazards;\n 4.Availability of off-street parking;\n 5.Availability of public transit and the likelihood of its use;\n 6.Feasibility of traffic mitigation measures; and\n 7.Impacts on public utilities, including water and sanitary sewer capacities.\n E.When a community group home is located on a lot abutting an RE-, RS-, or AG-R-zoned lot, a screening wall or fence must be provided along the common lot line in accordance with the F1 screening fence or wall standards of Subsection 65.070C."
